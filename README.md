# ElkloriaMod
This mod is meant to be a Minecraftization of Elkloria, the book series that I, Rishab Borah, wrote.<br>
This description may contain spoilers (for the mod and the series itself), as it is intended to be as accurate to Elkloria as possible.<br>
Elkloria has a huge and complex magical world, and as such this mod couldn't do justice to everything I've put in it.<br>
I will try to include the key points below, however.<br>
This is all planning:<br>
* A spellcasting system. There are 600ish spells in Elkloria, and I'm going to create a system for at least 10 of them to be castable. It's important to note that spells in Elkloria are spoken aloud for <em>good reason</em> and as such I might need to make them somewhat like commands. Additionally there are also the elemental kingdoms which means certain spells have restrictions, for example a mind-wizard can't create huge pools of water except through a lot of long spell-program chanting that takes more power than a water-wizard who simply says a few words and can make a lake.
 * Maybe, a wizard can do /spell <name> and this will "charge" them with the spell. To deploy the spell, they just press a button/right click something/idk. They can right click/whatever a second time to recast the spell.
 * Probably a training system, too, so that wizards need to cast a spell a few times before it works for them consistently
 * Maybe there should be an item or command to collect "identities"--lots of spells require identities, (the UUID of an entity or location of a block, for example) such as locator spells, so there needs to be a way to input those into a spell
* (Maybe) The reason they're spoken is because they can essentially be programmed. Spells in Elkloria can be linked and hooked together in special ways like a program. A lot of them also take 'parameters' of sorts that can be used to specify what they do, e.g. an illusion spell has a 'parameter' to specify what illusion to cast.
* (Maybe) Rituals and potions from Elkloria will also be hopefully added, like rituals and structure formulae
* (Maybe) 'Race' or 'ability' selection, so people can choose their elemental kingdom or their race. Naturally, I suppose a dark wizard would be created the way they are in Elkloria--via killing using magic.
 * Alternatively, instead of having someone choose the wizard race, I can add a "wand" item (this is technically a canonical item in the books) which allows those holding it to cast magic
* Potential races:
  * Wizard (selectable element?)
    * Dark wizard
  * Dragons - can shapeshift between human form and a dragon form which can fly and breathe a special type of fire
   * Dragon wizard (since dragons can be wizards) -- can use wizard magic in human form
  * Witch - a person who does specific rituals to do magic
    * Warlock - a witch who does rituals using dark magic
  * (Maybe) Psychomage--wizards and witches can adopt this ability in the real book, maybe we can also have Minecrafters be able to adopt this ability? Psychomagy is a complex ability in the book revolving around the mind and spirit plane, essentially the ability to weave emotions in order to bind spirits and use their powers or simply to affect people's minds; it might not be implementable in the game
  * (Maybe) Faery (Duine Sidhe)--these would have more or less the same abilities as wizards but with a different appearance and certain other powers (e.g. wing flight, affinity with plants)
  * (Maybe) Demon (Homoinferni)--these would only be able to shoot fireballs, hypnotize, make illusions, and break things and telekinetically move things--however, they would also start off in the demon world, maybe?
* Potential blocks:
 * (non-canon) Aethelum crystals - these can be harvested and eaten to quickly recharge aethelum
 * Mirror (?) - these do not actually show reflections but can be turned into portals to the mirror world
 * Statue - these are created by gorgons and have the shape of mobs; alternatively, they can be crafted using the identity item mentioned above and stone (identity item is left behind in the crafting table). They might also generate randomly in certain structures (?)
 * 
* Potential mobs:
 * Other wizards/dark wizards -- their attacks are indicated by the spell they use appearing in nearby players' personal chat
 * Other dragons/wizard dragons/dark wizard dragons
 * Witches/warlocks
 * Other Faeries
  * Duine Sidhe - human-sized faeries, like players, who can do wizard magic, have wings, etc. Plural: aes sidhe
  * Pixie - small faeries. They're kind of useless in Elkloria; maybe they can cluster around enchanted objects to give them a proper use
  * Cat Sidhe - small faery cats only found in the faery world which can absorb souls of the dead, teleport, and grow into panthers--maybe they can be tamed like pets. Plural: cait sidhe.
  * Dullahan - headless people only found in the faery world riding on horses who can kill a mob through their armor UNLESS the mob is near gold or wearing gold armor; gold anything repels dullahans
  * Hamadryad - pixie-like mobs who are connected to a specific heart-block inside of certain magical trees; if a tree has a heart-block, it can be a magical building material (?). Additionally, destroying the heart block kills the hamadryad, but the hamadryad will fight for its tree
  * Domovoi - Certain village houses/witch huts/etc will have a "sentience"-- these houses they will also have a fireplace. This means that the blocks in the house can turn into mobs (which are domovois, plural: domovije) and attack players who come near a house, preventing them from stealing from or inhabiting a villager's house. The block-mobs will return to where they flew from when the player is far away; killing the block-mob drops the same things its block would. A domovoi can be PLACATED by dropping food items and jewel items in the fireplace.
  * Landvaet - same thing as a domovoi, except for entire forests/fields; however, these will be special biomes. Plural of landvaet is landvaettir
  * Unicorn - these can, with the correct ritual, communicate with gods. They also passively heal nearby people and cause plants to grow
  * Dobharch√∫ - these look like otters and live in water in the faery realm, attacking players
  * Jabberwock - these are large dragon-type boss mobs, found (somewhere?) in the faery realm which can cause great destruction with their lightning-breath
  * Eidolon - these are faeries which can shapeshift into any random mob and use its powers
 * Centaurs - These gather in villages near Norikithintes Portals in Overworld and Usifia--they will prevent the player from going near it. Technically, centaurs in Elkloria don't do this (they're usually a lot like humans in their manner of thinking), but it creates a bit of difficulty in entering Elkloria
 * Wyverns - these are dragon-like creatures with two back legs who can hide in blocks like silverfish (their presence is indicated by a small green blob on the side of the block). They breathe a sort of black dragon-breath like the enderdragon which sets blocks on fire (black fire) and cannot be collected.
 * Spirit mobs? All of these will be capable of vanishing and reappearing at will (since they can flick in and out of the spiritual plane). 
  * Nurikabe - This can create invisible walls, is found near mountains, and will attack by biting? Appears as a floating wolf
  * Kitsune - This can shapeshift into any mob, is found near foxes, and attacks by turning into a mob and using its attacks?
  * Djinn -- tradeable mobs who can trade "wishes," which can be right clicked to perform the wish. If attacked, they become foes a lot like wizards but their attacks don't appear in the chat. 
 * Demon mobs -- found in Wildlandes biome and Inferna dimension
  * Homoinferni - Humanlike demon, can shoot fireballs, destroy things by touching them, create illusionary mobs, and, if the crosshair is on their head/eyes, the player will start to slowly move toward them. In Inferna, they form villages
  * Werewolves - found in any biome, players can become werewolves; these are villagers who become wolves at night and can scratch players
  * Vampires are too much work. I'm not adding them.
  * Specter - these are translucent and look like hooded, floating figures; they are more easily visible when looked at through a pumpkin (this is non-canon; they're technically easily visible in mirrors but we don't have those in Minecraft). If they touch you you will gain slowness.
  * Witch Demon - these are homoinfernies which can use dark magic like dark wizards
  * Gorgon - these are monsters which, if looked directly at, cause the one who looks at them to die instantly, leaving behind a stone statue shaped like them (somehow...?)
 * Trisken - These will be black mobs, including a woman with gray skin and purple eyes, which appears around a Trisken Altar, a block crafted with obsidian, gold, and demon blood. Trisken can bring nearby Statues to life and cause them to attack
 * Typhonic mobs -- these spawn in Typhon and in the ocean near Typhonic Storm mobs:
  * Leviathan - large monsters in the ocean. They will be capable of hitting players, and any player who collides with their head will be teleported to Inferna
  * Basilisk - these are serpents with wings and rooster heads that can be found primarily in swamps and ocean and can shoot a guardian-style laser from their eyes which kills instantly; they can deal poison damage by hitting you
* Potential dimensions:
 * (Maybe) A Usifia dimension where generated structures that resemble those in the book may be found, e.g. Wildlandes biome, Neurazian gate? Along with a strictly sized Neurazia dimension (similar to pre 1.9 End's size limit) and naturally generated 'Norikithintes Portals' in the Overworld dimension?
 * (Maybe) A demon world (Inferna) which can have demon villages and is primarily composed of brimstone blocks and molten with a red sky and a green sun. All non-demonic mobs will die upon entering it. This world can be originated in if you start as a demon in race selection, maybe?
  * Will have a Portal Storm biome, which spawns Portal Storm mobs, large mobs which look like tornadoes and teleport you to a nearby demon portal in Usifia and send blocks flying
 * (Maybe) A faery realm (Avalon) that can be traveled to or originated in through race selection with their own mobs and structures (maybe the faery realm can be procedurally generated and have the Ivory and Red kingdoms?)
  * (Maybe) A tulgye-tree generated structure--these trees will have apples on their branches, which, every so often, fall to the ground and transform into mushrooms upon hitting it; these mushrooms can be directly eaten from the player's hand and when eaten will randomly either make the player grow or shrink
 * (Maybe) The oceanic realm of Typhon, which is a dimension with only ocean and sea monsters and random mobs called Typhonic Storms which, when touched, teleport players to a random area in the overworld? Typhonic storms also spawn in overworld oceans?
  * Generated structure: Sarpedon, an island of gorgons
 * (Maybe) the world of the dead
  * This world will have random biomes and structures from every dimension, but its mobs will only ever be mobs the player who goes there has killed before--or pets of the player who have died. The mobs they killed will attack the player by floating and bumping them (if the mob is hostile it will also attempt to attack properly; maybe this can be achieved by having them ride on invisible mobs who deal damage on contact and repeatedly setting the attack target to the player?); the pets will simply follow the player.
 * (Maybe) The spirit world? This would have a lot of spirits; it will only be able to be traveled to astrally, in that the player will leave a body behind and will automatically return to the body if trying to leave the spirit world. Maybe it'll also have shrines to djinn; these shrines will summon a djinn when you enter it as a tradeable mob; the djinn will be neutral and capable of trading "wishes" to you, but if you attack the djinn it will be a powerful foe
* Nether + End will be considered not part of the Elkloria mod and as such some materials may need to be obtained from them but they themselves will not play a major role. However, Nether may be considered a connection to the demon world
* World gen:
 * (Maybe) The elemental kingdoms generated in terrain generation in Elkloria, perhaps in a specific area, with their own wizards/villagers and rules enforced by police mobs
 * (Maybe) "Spiritual places" -- places where spirits are common which have a lot of magic, indicated by the sky turning purple (non-canon) when entering them?
 * Wildlandes Biome and Silivrmiikmran Forest (where the Norikithintes Portal is found) Biome? Generates in Usifia
 * (Maybe) Demon portal generated structure-- a large volcano-type hill with lava in it and a bunch of portal blocks in the middle of the lava. It will also have "seal blocks" on top of it--translucent blocks with swirling designs--but these can be passed through.
* (Maybe) Egregores -- Egregores are basically just gods, created by witchcraft or psychomagy. To make one, you use a God Hammer (non-canonical item) on a block or entity, turning it into the egregore's shrine. When you do this, a gui will appear to select the egregore's powers and appearance; each power is on a single level, and an active and passive power is chosen; egregores do not need passive powers for every level. They must also have three items given in the gui, which don't match any other egregore, as their summoning trinity. You can then either worship the shrine by right-clicking it and performing the tasks given/giving it the items required, or get villagers to worship at the shrine--villager worship does not require tasks or items. The more worship they get the more powerful they are and the more powers they unlock (they start out with only their first level power); if the shrine is clicked with the God Hammer again it will show the egregore's status. They also can be summoned with the three items which can be placed in a Shrine Block to summon them. When summoned, they apply their passive power around them and can have "worship points" traded to them to use their active powers.
  * Worship is performed by villagers or players to empower egregores; it is important to note that players must worship egregores individually to gain individual worship points, which they can trade.
  * A player can only worship one egregore at a time; if a player tries to worship another a lightning bolt will strike at their location and they will be unable to.
