# ElkloriaMod
This mod is meant to be a Minecraftization of Elkloria, the book series that I, Rishab Borah, wrote.
Elkloria has a huge and complex magical world, and as such this mod couldn't do justice to everything I've put in it.
I will try to include the key points below, however.
This is all planning, I don't even know if I have the programming ability to include all of it:
* A spellcasting system. There are 600ish spells in Elkloria, and I'm going to create a system for at least 10 of them to be castable. It's important to note that spells in Elkloria are spoken aloud for <em>good reason</em> and as such I might need to make them somewhat like commands. Additionally there are also the elemental kingdoms which means certain spells have restrictions, for example a mind-wizard can't create huge pools of water except through a lot of long spell-program chanting that takes more power than a water-wizard who simply says a few words and can make a lake.
* (Maybe) The reason they're spoken is because they can essentially be programmed. Spells in Elkloria can be linked and hooked together in special ways like a program. A lot of them also take 'parameters' of sorts that can be used to specify what they do, e.g. an illusion spell has a 'parameter' to specify what illusion to cast.
* (Maybe) Rituals and potions from Elkloria will also be hopefully added, like rituals and structure formulae
* (Maybe) 'Race' or 'ability' selection, so people can choose their elemental kingdom or their race. Naturally, I suppose a dark wizard would be created the way they are in Elkloria--via killing using magic.
* Potential races:
  * Wizard (selectable element?)
    * Dark wizard
    * Dragons (since dragons are considered a type of wizard)
  * Witch
    * Warlock (evil witch)
  * (Maybe) Psychomage--wizards and witches can adopt this ability in the real book, maybe we can also have Minecrafters be able to adopt this ability? This is a complex ability in the book revolving around the mind; it might not be implementable in the game
  * (Maybe) Faery--these would have more or less the same abilities as wizards but with a different appearance and certain other powers (e.g. wing flight, affinity with plants)
  * (Maybe) Demon--these would only be able to shoot fireballs, hypnotize, make illusions, and break things and telekinetically move things--however, they would also start off in the demon world, maybe?
  * (Maybe) A Usifia dimension where generated structures that resemble those in the book may be found, e.g. Wildlandes biome, Neurazian gate? Along with a strictly sized Neurazia dimension (similar to pre 1.9 End's size limit) and naturally generated 'Norikithintes Portals' in the Overworld dimension?
  * Nether + End will be considered not part of the Elkloria mod and as such some materials may need to be obtained from them but they themselves will not play a major role. However, Nether may be considered a connection to the demon world
  * (Maybe) A demon world and faery realm that can be traveled to or originated in through race selection with their own mobs and structures (maybe the faery realm can be procedurally generated and have the Ivory and Red kingdoms?)
  * (Maybe) The oceanic realm of Typhon, the world of the dead, the spirit world, planet Alinusia? (all as other dimensions)
  * (Maybe) The elemental kingdoms generated in terrain generation in Elkloria, perhaps in a specific area, with their own laws and whatnot
  * (Maybe) Elklorian mobs, like unicorns and centaurs and sphinges and basilisks and wyverns and other wizard mobs?
  * (Maybe) Deity mobs, spirit mobs, djinn mobs, prophets (somehow), angels, egregores?
  * (Maybe) Boss mobs?
