# ElkloriaMod
This mod is meant to be a Minecraftization of Elkloria, the book series that I, Rishab Borah, wrote.
This description may contain spoilers, as it is intended to be as accurate to Elkloria as possible.
Elkloria has a huge and complex magical world, and as such this mod couldn't do justice to everything I've put in it.
I will try to include the key points below, however.
This is all planning, I don't even know if I have the programming ability to include all of it:
* A spellcasting system. There are 600ish spells in Elkloria, and I'm going to create a system for at least 10 of them to be castable. It's important to note that spells in Elkloria are spoken aloud for <em>good reason</em> and as such I might need to make them somewhat like commands. Additionally there are also the elemental kingdoms which means certain spells have restrictions, for example a mind-wizard can't create huge pools of water except through a lot of long spell-program chanting that takes more power than a water-wizard who simply says a few words and can make a lake.
 * Maybe, a wizard can do /spell <name> and this will "charge" them with the spell. To deploy the spell, they just press a button/right click something/idk. They can right click/whatever a second time to recast the spell.
 * Probably a training system, too, so that wizards need to cast a spell a few times before it works for them consistently
* (Maybe) The reason they're spoken is because they can essentially be programmed. Spells in Elkloria can be linked and hooked together in special ways like a program. A lot of them also take 'parameters' of sorts that can be used to specify what they do, e.g. an illusion spell has a 'parameter' to specify what illusion to cast.
* (Maybe) Rituals and potions from Elkloria will also be hopefully added, like rituals and structure formulae
* (Maybe) 'Race' or 'ability' selection, so people can choose their elemental kingdom or their race. Naturally, I suppose a dark wizard would be created the way they are in Elkloria--via killing using magic.
 * Alternatively, instead of having someone choose the wizard race, I can add a "wand" item (this is technically a canonical item in the books) which allows those holding it to cast magic
* Potential races:
  * Wizard (selectable element?)
    * Dark wizard
    * Dragons (since dragons are considered a type of wizard)
  * Witch
    * Warlock (evil witch)
  * (Maybe) Psychomage--wizards and witches can adopt this ability in the real book, maybe we can also have Minecrafters be able to adopt this ability? This is a complex ability in the book revolving around the mind; it might not be implementable in the game
  * (Maybe) Faery--these would have more or less the same abilities as wizards but with a different appearance and certain other powers (e.g. wing flight, affinity with plants)
  * (Maybe) Demon--these would only be able to shoot fireballs, hypnotize, make illusions, and break things and telekinetically move things--however, they would also start off in the demon world, maybe?
* Potential mobs:
 * Other wizards
 * Other dragons
 * Witches/warlocks
 * Other Faeries
  * Pixie - small faeries. They're kind of useless in Elkloria; maybe they can cluster around enchanted objects to give them a proper use
  * Cat Sidhe - small faery cats only found in the faery world which can absorb souls of the dead, teleport, and grow into panthers--maybe they can be tamed like pets. Plural: cait sidhe.
  * Dullahan - headless people only found in the faery world riding on horses who can kill a mob through their armor UNLESS the mob is near gold or wearing gold armor; gold anything repels dullahans
  * Hamadryad - pixie-like mobs who are connected to a specific heart-block inside of certain magical trees; if a tree has a heart-block, it can be a magical building material (?). Additionally, destroying the heart block kills the hamadryad, but the hamadryad will fight for its tree
  * Domovoi - Certain village houses/witch huts/etc will have a "sentience"-- these houses they will also have a fireplace. This means that the blocks in the house can turn into mobs (which are domovois, plural: domovije) and attack players who come near a house, preventing them from stealing from or inhabiting a villager's house. The block-mobs will return to where they flew from when the player is far away; killing the block-mob drops the same things its block would. A domovoi can be PLACATED by dropping food items and jewel items in the fireplace.
  * Landvaet - same thing as a domovoi, except for entire forests/fields; however, these will be special biomes. Plural of landvaet is landvaettir
  * Unicorn - these can, with the correct ritual, communicate with gods. They also passively heal nearby people and cause plants to grow
  * Dobharch√∫ - these look like otters and live in water in the faery realm, attacking players
  * Jabberwock - these are large dragon-type boss mobs, found (somewhere?) in the faery realm which can cause great destruction with their lightning-breath
  * Eidolon - these are faeries which can shapeshift into any random mob and use its powers
 * Centaurs - These gather in villages near Norikithintes Portals in Overworld and Usifia--they will prevent the player from going near it. Technically, centaurs in Elkloria don't do this (they're usually a lot like humans in their manner of thinking), but it creates a bit of difficulty in entering Elkloria
 * Basilisk - these are serpents with wings and rooster heads that can be found in caves and can shoot a guardian-style laser from their eyes which kills instantly; they can deal poison damage by hitting you
 * Wyverns - these are dragon-like creatures with two back legs who can hide in blocks like silverfish (their presence is indicated by a small green blob on the side of the block). They breathe black fire.
 * Spirit mobs? All of these will be capable of vanishing and reappearing at will (since they can flick in and out of the spiritual plane). 
  * Nurikabe - This can create invisible walls, is found near mountains, and will attack by biting? Appears as a floating wolf
  * Kitsune - This can shapeshift into any mob, is found near foxes, and attacks by turning into a mob and using its attacks?
  * Potentially egregores -- Egregores are basically just gods, created by witchcraft or psychomagy, and empowered by making a shrine and having villagers worship at the shrine--or, of course, players can worship the egregore. They can be given different types of powers, and the more worship they get the more powerful they are. They also must be indicated with three items (unique items) which can be placed in a special ritual to summon them. They can be told to do certain things using some kind of ritual (?)
 * Demon mobs -- found in Wildlandes biome and Inferna dimension
  * Homoinferni - Humanlike demon, can shoot fireballs, destroy things by touching them, create illusionary mobs, and, if the crosshair is on their head/eyes, the player will start to slowly move toward them
  * 
* Potential dimensions:
 * (Maybe) A Usifia dimension where generated structures that resemble those in the book may be found, e.g. Wildlandes biome, Neurazian gate? Along with a strictly sized Neurazia dimension (similar to pre 1.9 End's size limit) and naturally generated 'Norikithintes Portals' in the Overworld dimension?
 * (Maybe) A demon world (Inferna) and faery realm (Avalon) that can be traveled to or originated in through race selection with their own mobs and structures (maybe the faery realm can be procedurally generated and have the Ivory and Red kingdoms?)
 * (Maybe) The oceanic realm of Typhon, the world of the dead, the spirit world, planet Alinusia? (all as other dimensions)
* Nether + End will be considered not part of the Elkloria mod and as such some materials may need to be obtained from them but they themselves will not play a major role. However, Nether may be considered a connection to the demon world
* World gen:
 * (Maybe) The elemental kingdoms generated in terrain generation in Elkloria, perhaps in a specific area, with their own laws and whatnot
 * "Spiritual places" -- places where spirits are common which have a lot of magic, indicated by the sky turning purple (non-canon) when entering them?
 * Wildlandes Biome and Silivrmiikmran Forest (where the Norikithintes Portal is found) Biome? Generates in Usifia
